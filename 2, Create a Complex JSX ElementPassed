Define a new constant JSX that renders a div which contains the following elements in order:

An h1, a p, and an unordered list that contains three li items. You can include any text you want within each element.

Solution:

const JSX = (
 <div>
  <h1> heading </h1>
   <p> paragraph </p>
     <ul>
       <li> item 1 </li>
       <li> item 2 </li>
       <li> item 3 </li>
    </ul>
 </div>
)
