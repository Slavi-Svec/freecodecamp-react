The code editor has a JSX element similar to what you created in the last challenge. 
Add a comment somewhere within the provided div element,
without modifying the existing h1 or p elements.

Solution:

const JSX = (
 <div>
    <h1>This is a block of JSX</h1>
    { /* this is a comment */ }
    <p>Here's a subtitle</p>
 </div>
);
